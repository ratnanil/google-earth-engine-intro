## Demo in an html file

As per instructions in the slides, create an html file and open this file in a browser window. Create opening and closing  `<script>` tags.

```html
<script>
</script>
```

Now, start developping javascript code in between the `<script>` tags.

```js
// create a var, have a look at the browser.
var myname = "Nils Ratnaweera";

// where is this var?
// show that the variable exists
```

Demonstrate `console.log`.


```js
// this wont show in the console
var myname = "Nils Ratnaweera";

myname;
```


```js
// adding this will:
console.log(myname);

console.log("Hi, my name is "+myname);
```
